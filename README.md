## Description

**Web scraping**, also known as **web data extraction**, is the process of retrieving or ‚Äúscraping‚Äù data from a website. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet‚Äôs seemingly endless frontier.

**This project demonstrates an example of Web scraping by retrieving data from the [Movies | NETFLIX](https://www.netflix.com/ug/browse/genre/34399) webpage and presenting it to the user.**


The Scraper presents retrieved data to the user in 3 phases all of which depend on their selection or response :

- **Phase 1** : A list of movie categories
- **Phase 2** : A list of movies from a particular category
- **Phase 3** : Information about **A MOVIE** from the list of movies in **Phase 2**

1. When you choose to continue, the Scraper will take a couple of seconds to fetch the required information.
1. When it is done retrieving data, it will display a list of movie categories as seen in the **CATEGORIES** image above.
1. At this point, below the list, the Scraper will ask you to enter a category selection by typing the number appearing before your choice of category.
1. When you enter a valid number, the scraper will display a list of movies contained with in your category of choice as seen in the **MOVIE LIST** image above
